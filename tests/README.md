# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the Formbricks Hub API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure:

1. PostgreSQL is running (via docker-compose)
2. Database migrations have been applied
3. The test API key exists in the database

## Running Tests

Run all integration tests:
```bash
go test ./tests/... -v
```

Run a specific test:
```bash
go test ./tests -run TestHealthEndpoint -v
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test ./tests/... -v -cover
```

## Test Structure

- `integration_test.go` - Main integration tests for all API endpoints
- `helpers.go` - Helper functions for test setup and cleanup

## Test Coverage

The integration tests cover:

- ✅ Health endpoint (public)
- ✅ Create experience (with/without auth)
- ✅ List experiences (with filters)
- ✅ Get experience by ID
- ✅ Update experience
- ✅ Delete experience
- ✅ Search experiences (placeholder)
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Error handling

## Test API Key

The tests use a predefined API key: `test-api-key-12345`

This key is automatically created when you run `go run ./cmd/createkey`

## Notes

- Tests use the actual database configured in `.env`
- Tests create real data in the database
- Consider using a separate test database for isolation
- The search endpoint tests will pass but return empty results until search is implemented
